# Email Spam Detection 📧

## Internship Details
- **Program:** AICTE Oasis Infobyte Internship (OIBSIP)
- **Domain:** Data Science
- **Task:** Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
Spam emails are unwanted messages that are often sent in bulk and may contain scams,
phishing links, or misleading information.

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can classify emails
as **spam** or **not spam (ham)** based on their content.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **Name:** spam.csv
- **Description:**  
  The dataset contains:
  - Email message text
  - Label indicating whether the email is spam or ham

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Jupyter Notebook (VS Code / Colab)

---

## 🔍 Approach
1. Loaded the email dataset using Pandas
2. Cleaned the data and selected relevant columns
3. Converted labels into numerical format
4. Transformed text data using TF-IDF Vectorizer
5. Split the dataset into training and testing sets
6. Trained a Naive Bayes classifier
7. Evaluated the model using accuracy and classification report
8. Tested the model with sample email text

---

## 📈 Results
- The model successfully classified emails as spam or not spam
- High accuracy was achieved using the Naive Bayes algorithm

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning and text processing techniques can be
used to solve real-world problems such as email spam detection.

It helped in understanding text vectorization, classification models, and NLP concepts.
