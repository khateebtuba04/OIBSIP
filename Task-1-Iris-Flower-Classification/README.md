# Iris Flower Classification 🌸

## Internship Details
- **Program:** AICTE Oasis Infobyte Internship (OIBSIP)
- **Domain:** Data Science
- **Task:** Iris Flower Classification

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
The Iris dataset contains measurements of iris flowers belonging to three different species:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify the species of an iris flower based on its physical measurements.
