# Iris Flower Classification 🌸

## Problem Statement
The Iris dataset contains measurements of iris flowers. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can classify iris flowers into three species:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

## Dataset
- Iris.csv
- Features: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width
- Target: Species

## Approach
1. Loaded and explored the dataset
2. Performed data preprocessing
3. Split the data into training and testing sets
4. Trained a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model
5. Evaluated the model using accuracy and classification report

## Model Used
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Results
The model achieved high accuracy in classifying iris flower species, demonstrating effective performance.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Internship
This project is completed as part of the **Oasis Infobyte AICTE Internship (OIBSIP)** in the **Data Science** domain.
