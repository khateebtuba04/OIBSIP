# Sales Prediction using Python 📈

## Internship Details
- **Program:** AICTE Oasis Infobyte Internship (OIBSIP)
- **Domain:** Data Science
- **Task:** Sales Prediction using Python

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
Sales prediction involves estimating how much of a product will be sold based on factors
such as advertising expenditure and marketing strategy.

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict product
sales based on advertising budgets spent on TV, Radio, and Newspaper platforms.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Name:** Advertising.csv
- **Description:**  
  The dataset contains:
  - TV advertising budget
  - Radio advertising budget
  - Newspaper advertising budget
  - Sales (Target variable)

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook (VS Code / Colab)

---

## 🔍 Approach
1. Loaded the advertising dataset using Pandas
2. Performed basic data exploration and visualization
3. Removed unnecessary columns
4. Selected advertising features and sales as target
5. Split the data into training and testing sets
6. Trained a Linear Regression model
7. Evaluated the model using R² score and Mean Absolute Error
8. Predicted sales using sample advertising values

---

## 📈 Results
- The model successfully predicted sales based on advertising expenditure
- Linear Regression showed good performance for sales prediction

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to predict sales and support
business decision-making.

It helped in understanding regression models, data visualization, and real-world
applications of data science.
